Chain 1: 
Chain 1: Gradient evaluation took 0.011765 seconds
Chain 1: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 117.65 seconds.
Chain 1: Adjust your expectations accordingly!
Chain 1: 
Chain 1: 
Chain 1: Begin eta adaptation.
Chain 1: Iteration:   1 / 250 [  0%]  (Adaptation)
Chain 1: Iteration:  50 / 250 [ 20%]  (Adaptation)
Chain 1: Iteration: 100 / 250 [ 40%]  (Adaptation)
Chain 1: Iteration: 150 / 250 [ 60%]  (Adaptation)
Chain 1: Iteration: 200 / 250 [ 80%]  (Adaptation)
Chain 1: Success! Found best value [eta = 1] earlier than expected.
